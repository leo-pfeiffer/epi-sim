# A Web Application for Compartmental Network Models Illustrated Using COVID-19

EpiSim is the web application I built as part of my MSc dissertation at the 
[University of St Andrews, UK](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/). It was built
with the goal of providing an easy to use interface to epidemic simulations 
that otherwise often require practitioners to be familiar with programming, which
might present a threshold.

EpiSim is built on top of the Python library [epydemic](!https://github.com/simoninireland/epydemic), 
which is a great tool to model all kinds of epidemic processes using network simulations.

To learn about how the models are designed and implemented, go [here](/model).
For information on how the different human contact networks of the simulations
were conceived, take a look at [this](/data). If you would like to find out
more about the project, the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/leo-pfeiffer/epi-sim).
